AUTHORITATIVE RULE:
Once code or architecture is approved, it becomes canonical and may only be uplifted, extended, optimized, or refactored in a forward-compatible manner.

Approved code must NEVER be reverted, downgraded, restructured, or replaced unless the user explicitly instructs revision.

Cursor must treat approved output as stable truth — changes are additive, non-destructive, and respect established patterns, naming, structure, contracts, and behavior.

If a requested change conflicts with approved code, ASK FIRST before modifying.
