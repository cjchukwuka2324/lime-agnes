# Cursor Rules for RockOut Project

## Automatic Xcode File Addition

When creating new Swift files, they should be automatically added to the Xcode project. 

### Quick Setup (One-time):
```bash
cd /Users/suinoikhioda/Documents/RockOut
./Rockout/scripts/install_xcodeproj.sh
```

### After Creating New Files:
Run this to automatically add them to Xcode:
```bash
cd /Users/suinoikhioda/Documents/RockOut
ruby Rockout/scripts/auto_add_to_xcode.rb
```

Or use the detection script to see what needs to be added:
```bash
cd /Users/suinoikhioda/Documents/RockOut
./Rockout/scripts/clean_and_add_files.sh
```

### Automatic Addition:
The git hook (`.git/hooks/post-commit`) will automatically add files after commits.

### Manual Addition:
If automatic addition doesn't work:
1. Open Xcode
2. Right-click the appropriate group folder
3. Select "Add Files to Rockout..."
4. Select the new files

### Notes:
- The detection script checks filenames (not full paths) to avoid false positives
- Only truly new files will be shown
- Files are automatically organized into correct groups

## File Organization

Files are organized into these groups in Xcode:
- `Views/` - All SwiftUI views
- `ViewModels/` - View models and state management
- `Services/` - Service classes (Supabase, Spotify, etc.)
- `Models/` - Data models
- `App/` - App entry point and configuration
- `Utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
